# Outside light system

This system is to be uploaded to an arduino.

The system should do the following
- Sense motion
- Turn on an indicator for each motion sensor that is triggered
- Sense darkness
- Turn on a separate 120v light system if it is dark enough and motion sensors are tripped
- Turn on ultrasonic speakers if motion sensors are tripped
- Have an override for the lights to turn them on
- Have an override for the ultrasonic speakers to turn them off
